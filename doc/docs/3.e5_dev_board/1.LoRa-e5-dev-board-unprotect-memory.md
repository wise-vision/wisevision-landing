## 1. Introduction

This document describes how to unprotect the memory of the LoRa e5 dev board on the Ubuntu system (Ubuntu 22.04)

2. STM32CubeProgrammer
3. ST-LINK v2 or ST-LINK v3


## 2. Unprotect memory steps

#

4. Click on the "Connect" button 

NOTE: You have to power on the board with the USB-C cable before clicking on the "Connect" button.

The connection should be established. If not, check the connection and try again. You can also try pressing the reset button on the LoRa e5 dev board and restart.

#
5. Go to the "Option Bytes" tab
In the RDP field select value "AA" or (0xAA) and click on the "Apply" button.
