# WiseVision Data Black Box

## Introduction

The WiseVision Data Black Box is a tool for recording and replaying data in ROS 2. It is designed to
be a hub for all kinds of data in ROS 2, including images, point clouds, and other sensor data. The
Data Black Box can be used to record data from a robot or other device, and then replay it later for
testing or analysis.

Unlike the ROS 2 bag format, which is also designed for recording and replaying messages, the
WiseVision Data Black Box is designed to record and replay data at the same time and also be a
"power lost" safe solution. This means that if the power is lost while recording data, the Data
Black Box will still be able to recover the data when power is restored.
